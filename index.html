                                    Summer is here and boy it’s here to stay. Be your daily office commute or a weekend getaway, travelling without AC is going to be dreadful. Given that the temperature inside the car cabin can rise up to 60°C, checking up on your car AC should be your top priority. There can be a host of issues creeping up like low cooling, odour, failed compressor and many others. Although regular AC maintenance should be a ritual, it is generally prescribed to get a full car AC service every year to keep the cooling at maximum efficiency.

                                <p>
                                    Alignment refers to an adjustment of a vehicle’s suspension – the system that connects a vehicle to its wheels. It is not an adjustment of the tires or wheels themselves. The key to proper alignment is adjusting the angles of the tires which affects how they make contact with the road.

                                    Transmission Is Slipping: If you are experiencing transmission slipping, it will feel like you are driving in one gear and then it will change for no reason. It might also make a whining noise when this happens. If this happens to you when you are driving, there is an issue with your transmission and you need to get it fixed as soon as possible. This could occur because your transmission fluid is too low or a lack of maintenance. This can cause wear and tear on your entire transmission system. Eventually, this will lead to worse problems and you will need to repair your transmission.
